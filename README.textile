h2. Two light-weight plugins for publishing Blogsmith liveblog content

p. For the premiere, full-featured Liveblog Publisher, check out Joe Bartlett's "Liveblog Publisher":https://github.com/aoltech/liveblog-publisher.

p. This is a light-weight adaptation built for use with jQuery 1.5.2 and below.

p. LbL is two simple plugins. @$.liveBlogLiteApi@ fetches liveblog data using a postid and a domain and provides updates via a custom event. @$.liveBlogLiteUi@ is a simple, example implementation of the UI to respond to these updates that responds to new content, edits, comments, and deletions.

p. *Credit where credit is due:* Liveblog Publisher (LbP) was heavily consulted in writing this lighter version. Some patterns were even copied entirely.

h2. How to use @$.liveBlogLiteApi@ and @$.liveBlogLiteUi@

# LbL requires jQuery 1.5.2 or higher. (It may work with even older versions of jQuery - we haven't tested how low it will go, yet.)
# Download @dist/aol.livebloglite.min.js@ and add it to your project.
# Add the CSS to your page: @assets/prod/css/aol.livebloglite.css@. (These are sample styles only - feel free to use the @.scss@ file as reference for creating your own: @assets/scss/aol.livebloglite.scss@.
# Instantiate it using code along these lines:

bc..  $(document).ready(function () {
  // <div id="myLiveBlog"></div> is the container element in the markup
  var $myLiveBlog = $('#myLiveBlog').liveBlogLiteUi({
    // This is an example post on the Bootcamp blog
    postId: '20317028',
    // This is the URL to the Bootcamp blog
    url: 'http://bootcamp.aol.com/'
  });
});

h2. A Warning About Sandboxes

bq..
CMS can not, will not, has never, and will never dynamically update Sandbox'd Sites in Beta mode. Beta Mode is strictly for testing a site with the production level caching layer turned on. It is built this way to discourage people from trying to run production sites from the sandbox.

"If you wish to test a Live Update post, and have it update LIVE. 1. Turn off Beta mode. 2. Point the updater to the production api.
